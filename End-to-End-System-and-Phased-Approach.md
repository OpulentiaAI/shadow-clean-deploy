## End-to-End System Overview and Phased Delivery Approach

### Document Purpose
This document describes the end-to-end architecture, critical flows, non-functional requirements, and a pragmatic phased plan to deliver and scale the system. It is intentionally technology-agnostic and can be adapted to specific stacks.

---

## 1) Executive Summary
- **Goal**: Deliver a reliable, secure, and scalable system that supports core user journeys end-to-end.
- **Approach**: Ship value incrementally through phases, de-risk early, enable feedback, and scale predictably.
- **Outcomes**: Measurable improvements in time-to-value, quality, and operational excellence.

---

## 2) Objectives and Scope
- **Primary objectives**:
  - Enable core user journeys with high availability and low latency
  - Ensure data integrity, security, and compliance from day one
  - Establish CI/CD, observability, and IaC for repeatable operations
- **Out of scope (initially)**:
  - Advanced ML, multi-region active-active, deep customization

---

## 3) Personas and Top Use Cases
- **Personas**:
  - End User: Uses web/mobile client to accomplish tasks
  - Admin/Operator: Manages configuration and monitors the system
  - Analyst: Consumes data for insights and reporting
- **Top use cases**:
  - Sign up, sign in, account management
  - Core business transaction flow (create/read/update)
  - Background processing and notifications
  - Reporting and analytics views

---

## 4) System Architecture Overview
- **Clients**: Web SPA, Mobile app, Admin console
- **Edge**: CDN, WAF, TLS termination, API Gateway
- **Services**: Auth service, Core domain service(s), Notification service, Background workers
- **Data**: Primary OLTP database, object storage, cache layer, queue/stream
- **Analytics**: ETL/ELT to warehouse/lakehouse, BI/metrics layer
- **Observability**: Centralized logs, metrics, traces, alerting
- **Platform**: CI/CD pipeline, Secrets management, IaC, Container orchestration

### Reference Architecture (Conceptual)
- Client → Edge (CDN/WAF) → API Gateway → Services → DB/Cache/Queue → Workers → External Integrations
- ETL jobs move data from OLTP/Queue to Warehouse for analytics/BI

---

## 5) End-to-End Flows
### 5.1 Authentication Flow
1. User initiates login from client
2. API Gateway routes to Auth service
3. Auth service validates credentials/IdP, issues tokens (short-lived access, long-lived refresh)
4. Client stores tokens securely; subsequent requests include access token

### 5.2 Core Transaction Flow (Create/Update)
1. Client submits request via API Gateway
2. Core service validates input, applies business rules, writes to DB (transactional)
3. Core service publishes event to queue/stream for async processing
4. Workers handle side-effects (notifications, projections, indexing)
5. Response returns synchronously with created/updated resource

### 5.3 Reporting/Analytics Flow
1. Incremental ETL/ELT from OLTP/Queue to Warehouse
2. Transformations build curated data models
3. BI/Reporting tools read from Warehouse for dashboards

---

## 6) Data Model (High-Level)
- Entities: User, Account/Profile, Resource/Item, Transaction/Order, AuditEvent
- Relationships: User ↔ Resource (ownership), Transaction ↔ User/Resource
- Storage:
  - OLTP: normalized relational schema for consistency
  - Cache: hot reads, computed aggregates
  - Object storage: large payloads and exports
  - Warehouse: star/snowflake schemas for analytics

---

## 7) Security, Privacy, and Compliance
- **AuthN**: OIDC/OAuth 2.0, SSO where applicable
- **AuthZ**: Role-based, optionally attribute-based for fine-grained control
- **Data protection**: TLS in transit, encryption at rest, key rotation
- **Secrets**: Managed vault, short-lived credentials
- **Network**: Private subnets, security groups, least privilege, egress controls
- **Auditing**: Immutable audit trail for security-relevant actions
- **Compliance**: GDPR/CCPA alignment; SOC 2/ISO 27001 readiness

---

## 8) Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
- **Availability**: ≥ 99.9% (MVP), ≥ 99.95% (Scale)
- **Latency**: P95 API < 300 ms for core reads; < 800 ms for writes
- **Throughput**: Scale linearly with demand; baseline capacity targets defined per phase
- **Durability**: Strong consistency for OLTP; eventual for derived views
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling with autoscaling policies
- **Cost**: Track unit economics; budgets and alerts
- **Maintainability**: Modular services, clear SLAs, well-documented APIs

---

## 9) Observability and Operations
- **Logging**: Structured, centralized, with PII redaction
- **Metrics**: RED/USE + domain KPIs; SLOs with error budgets
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing across edge, services, and workers
- **Alerting**: Symptom-based alerts tied to SLOs; paging playbooks
- **Runbooks**: Standard operating procedures for incidents, rollbacks, DR

---

## 10) Environments and Release Management
- **Environments**: Local → Dev → Staging → Production
- **Branching**: Trunk-based with short-lived feature branches
- **CI/CD**: Build, test, scan, deploy; feature flags for safe rollout
- **Release**: Canary/blue-green; automated rollback on health regression

---

## 11) Integrations and Dependencies
- External identity provider (IdP)
- Email/SMS providers for notifications
- Payment or third-party APIs as required
- Data export/import connectors

---

## 12) Risks and Assumptions
- **Risks**: Scope creep, integration instability, data model churn, infra cost spikes
- **Mitigations**: Incremental delivery, contract-first APIs, cost guardrails, early load testing
- **Assumptions**: Team capacity available; baseline cloud and CI/CD tooling in place

---
